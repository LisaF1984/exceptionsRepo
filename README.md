## Generics

Generics were introduced with the aim of reducing bugs and adding an extra layer of abstraction over types.
Generics enforce type correctness at compile time and enable implementing generic algorithms without causing any extra overhead to our applications as we do not need to define a type, this will not however work with primitive data types.

The idea is, we should be able to create the functionality for ANY datatype!
